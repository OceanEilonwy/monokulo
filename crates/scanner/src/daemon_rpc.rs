//! Real `MoneroDaemonClient` implementation, talking to `monerod`'s actual RPC
//! surface over `reqwest` + `rustls`. Every endpoint and field name used here was
//! verified against a live public node (`node.hollingworth.xyz:18089`, restricted
//! RPC) before being written, the same way `key_custody`'s crypto was verified
//! against `monero-rs`'s own source rather than assumed from memory - see the
//! `#[ignore]`d tests at the bottom of this file for the live proof.
//!
//! Two RPC surfaces are in play: the JSON-RPC envelope at `/json_rpc` (used for
//! `get_block`), and monerod's "other" plain-JSON endpoints (`/get_height`,
//! `/get_transaction_pool`, `/get_transactions`, `/is_key_image_spent`) which are
//! not wrapped in a `jsonrpc`/`result` envelope at all.
