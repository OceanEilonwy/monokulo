//! The persistence layer. A `Store` wraps one `rusqlite::Connection` and is not
//! `Sync` on its own — SQLite allows exactly one writer at a time regardless, so the
//! production async layer is expected to guard a `Store` behind a single owner (a
//! dedicated thread receiving commands over a channel, or, as used for the
//! concurrency test in this module, an `Arc<Mutex<Store>>`) rather than opening many
//! writable connections. Read-only access can use as many separate connections as
//! needed (SQLite's WAL mode allows concurrent readers alongside the one writer) —
//! that pool is not implemented here, since every method below is exercised directly
//! against a single connection for correctness testing.
//!
//! This module intentionally has no `KeyCustody` dependency: deriving a subaddress
//! for a new order happens *before* `create_order` is called, by whatever orchestrates
//! order creation (the future HTTP handler / writer actor) — `Store` only persists the
//! result.
