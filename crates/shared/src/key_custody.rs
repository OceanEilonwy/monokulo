//! The `KeyCustody` boundary.
//!
//! Everything on the caller's side of this trait — the HTTP API, the chain scanner,
//! the tenant registry — deals only in [`WalletHandle`]s. Nobody outside a
//! `KeyCustody` implementation ever holds a private view key in their own stack
//! frame or struct. That's the whole point of drawing the line here: it's the one
//! seam a future implementation can slot behind to change *where* key material
//! physically lives (this process's heap, a sealed enclave, a remote HSM) without
//! touching the scanner, the tenant model, or the API layer at all.
//!
//! `PlainKeyCustody` (`scanner`'s `src/key_custody/plain.rs`) is the only
//! in-process implementation. It keeps view pairs in ordinary process memory with
//! no encryption and no isolation from the host process — appropriate for a
//! self-hosted, single-tenant deployment, where a host-level attacker already owns
//! the one wallet on the box regardless of what this backend does. A multi-tenant,
//! hosted deployment should implement this trait against a TEE (AWS Nitro Enclaves,
//! AMD SEV-SNP) instead, so that compromising the host process yields scan requests
//! and results but never the keys that answered them. See the design notes in the
//! project README for why SGX specifically is a poor fit for this workload
//! (secret-scalar EC multiplication is exactly what its published side-channel
//! attacks target) and why VM-based isolation is preferred.
//!
//! ## Why this trait lives in `shared`, not `scanner`, as of WBS 2.1.3
//!
//! Every other engine type lives in `scanner` (`src/key_custody/mod.rs` used
//! to define all of this directly) — `shared` only ever held logic genuinely common
//! to the engine and the monokulo (secret-token hashing, HMAC signing,
//! password hashing, the migration runner), none of which is domain-specific the
//! way `KeyCustody` is. This module is the one exception, and it exists here for a
//! structural reason, not a style one: `scanner`'s own `main.rs` needs to be
//! able to construct either `key_custody::PlainKeyCustody` (in-process) or
//! `key_custody_service::client::SocketKeyCustody` (talks to a separate
//! `key-custody-server` process over a Unix socket - WBS 2.1.2) behind one config
//! flag. `key-custody-service`'s wire DTOs (`WalletMaterialWire`,
//! `KeyCustodyErrorWire`, ...) convert to and from these exact types - `WalletHandle`,
//! `WalletMaterial`, `KeyCustodyError`, `MatchedOutput`, and the `KeyCustody` trait
//! itself - so as long as those types were defined inside `scanner`,
//! `key-custody-service` had to depend on `scanner` to reach them (true since
//! WBS 2.1.1). Once `main.rs` (part of the `scanner` package) also needs to
//! depend on `key-custody-service` for `SocketKeyCustody`, that becomes
//! `scanner -> key-custody-service -> scanner` - a real, hard cycle
//! Cargo refuses outright (`error: cyclic package dependency`, confirmed by actually
//! attempting it, not just reasoned about) - not a lint or a style complaint, a
//! build that cannot succeed. Moving the trait and its domain types to `shared`
//! (which nothing in this cycle needs to depend on `scanner` to reach) breaks
//! it: `key-custody-service` now depends on `shared` for these types instead of
//! `scanner`, `scanner` re-exports them from `shared` so every existing
//! `scanner::key_custody::{KeyCustody, WalletHandle, ...}` import in the
//! engine keeps compiling completely unchanged (a `pub use` re-export is the same
//! type, not a wrapper - nothing downstream of `scanner::key_custody` needed
//! to change), and `main.rs` can finally depend on `key-custody-service` directly.
//! `PlainKeyCustody` itself, and its real registry/caching logic, stays exactly
//! where it was (`scanner`'s own `src/key_custody/plain.rs`) - only the
//! *boundary* (trait + wire-crossing types) needed to move; the one in-process
//! implementation the WBS explicitly never asked to touch did not.
//!
//! The socket *server* side (`key-custody-server`'s own `server.rs`, wrapping a
//! real `PlainKeyCustody`) still needs `scanner` - there is no way around
//! that, since `PlainKeyCustody` only exists there - which is exactly why the
//! server binary and the client/protocol code that `main.rs` needs were split into
//! two separate crates (`key-custody-server` depends on both `scanner` and
//! `key-custody-service`; `key-custody-service` itself depends on neither
//! `scanner` nor `key-custody-server`). See `docs/WOOCOMMERCE_WBS.md`'s
//! 2.1.3 entry and this session's `work_notes.md` entry for the full account of why
//! this split was necessary, not just tidier.
