//! Shared helpers for `monero::Network`, used wherever a network name crosses a
//! text boundary: the config file (`[monero_node.<network>]`), the admin API
//! (`CreateTenantRequest.network`), and the `tenants.network` column.
//!
//! Deliberately rejects anything that isn't an exact, recognized name rather than
//! silently defaulting to mainnet on a typo - an earlier version of this parser did
//! exactly that, which was harmless while there was only ever one daemon
//! connection regardless of network, but became a real hazard once network
//! selection determines *which chain gets scanned* (a mistyped network on tenant
//! creation could otherwise silently derive an address for one chain while never
//! being scanned against it, or against the wrong one).
//!
//! Moved here from `moneropay-core`'s own `src/network.rs` alongside
//! `key_custody` for WBS 2.1.3 (see that module's doc comment for the full
//! reasoning): `key-custody-service`'s wire DTOs need the same mainnet/stagenet/
//! testnet string mapping `moneropay-core` already uses everywhere else, and
//! reimplementing a second copy of it there risked exactly the kind of drift
//! this module's own doc comment above already warns against (a network name
//! silently meaning something different in two places). `moneropay-core`'s
//! `src/network.rs` now just re-exports this module verbatim, so every existing
//! `crate::network::{parse_network, network_str}` call in the engine keeps
//! compiling unchanged.
