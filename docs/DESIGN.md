# MoneroPay — Design Document

Status: pre-implementation design. Everything here except the `key_custody` module
(`src/key_custody/`) and the schema (`migrations/0001_init.sql`) is specification, not
code. Where those two exist already, this document describes them at the level of
"what an engineer needs to know to use or extend them," not a restatement of their
source — read the code itself for exact signatures when in doubt.

## 1. Purpose

A self-hostable Monero payment gateway for static sites with no backend of their own
(the motivating case: a site on GitHub Pages). The site embeds a small client library
that talks, via `fetch`, to a separately-hosted payment service — typically running on
the merchant's own home router — which renders a checkout UI (iframed or linked
directly), tracks orders, watches the chain for payment, and notifies the merchant via
webhook.

It is designed from day one to also work as a multi-tenant, community-hosted instance
serving many unrelated merchants, without that being a different code path — a
self-hosted deployment is simply a deployment with one tenant.

## 2. Goals

- **Trivial to set up.** One config file, one binary, sensible defaults. No database
  server, no sidecar processes (notably: no `monero-wallet-rpc`).
- **Single static executable, no dynamic libraries.** Must build for
  `*-unknown-linux-musl` and run on modest ARM or x86 router-class hardware.
- **Minimal resource use.** The host is usually also doing routing, DHCP, Wi-Fi, and
  possibly other services; this should not compete meaningfully for CPU or memory.
- **Fast 0-conf detection.** Mempool visibility within about a second of broadcast,
  without pulling in a C dependency (ZMQ) to get it.
- **Multi-tenant capable, single-tenant simple.** The tenant abstraction must not add
  ceremony to the one-merchant case.
- **Never able to move funds.** Every wallet this system knows about is watch-only.
  There is no code path, in any configuration, that holds or uses a private spend key.
- **DDoS-resistant by default**, since several endpoints are necessarily unauthenticated
  (a static site has nowhere to keep a secret).
- **Reusable and open-sourceable.** Design boundaries (`KeyCustody` chief among them)
  so a hosted, security-hardened deployment is a plugged-in backend, not a fork.

## 3. Non-Goals (v1)

Explicitly out of scope, and not accidentally so — call these out if a change request
would reintroduce them:

- **Automated refunds or any outbound Monero transaction.** No spend key exists
  anywhere in this system to make one possible. A refund address is recorded for the
  merchant to action manually, forever, not just in v1.
- **ZMQ-based mempool push notifications.** Requires `libzmq`, a C library, in tension
  with "no dynamic libraries" and "as small as possible." Mempool polling (~1s) is the
  v1 mechanism; ZMQ is a possible opt-in feature-flagged enhancement later, never a
  default dependency.
- **Subaddress index recycling.** Indices are allocated monotonically per tenant and
  never reused. This is a deliberate simplicity/privacy tradeoff (see §8.2); recycling
  is a scaling optimization for a high-volume tenant, not a v1 concern.
- **A platform/operator admin tier** for the hosted multi-tenant case (an operator
  looking at *any* tenant's data for support purposes). Only tenant self-service auth
  exists in v1. This is a materially different, higher-privilege concept and should get
  its own explicit, clearly-named route namespace when it's actually built — never a
  quiet override on tenant-scoped routes.
- **Gated/invite-only tenant creation** on a hosted instance. v1 tenant creation is
  open, protected only by the standard DDoS layer (§12).
- **In-place webhook secret rotation.** Rotate via delete-and-recreate.
- **Defending against reorgs deeper than a configured window.** The window only needs
  to comfortably exceed `confirmations_required`; deeper reorgs are a statement about
  Monero consensus economics, not something application code should try to override.
- **TEE-backed `KeyCustody` implementation.** The boundary is built to make this a
  drop-in backend later (§6), but v1 ships only the plaintext `PlainKeyCustody`.
- **Generating Monero wallets on the operator's behalf.** `--init` (§4.1) walks a
  self-hoster through *entering* their existing wallet's view/spend keys, never
  through creating a new wallet — this project has no reason to touch spend-key
  material, and a self-hoster is assumed to already have (or know how to make,
  with `monero-wallet-cli` or any other wallet software) the wallet they want to
  receive into.

## 4. Deployment Model

Both of the following are the same binary, same schema, same code path — the only
difference is how many rows exist in `tenants`:

- **Self-hosted, single-tenant.** One `tenants` row, created once at first boot from
  the TOML config's `[wallet]` section (an internal call into the same logic
  `POST /api/v1/admin/tenants` uses — not necessarily an HTTP round-trip against
  itself).
- **Hosted, multi-tenant.** Tenants are created at runtime via the admin API, each
  bringing their own watch-only wallet. New tenants must be scannable without a
  restart (§7.3).

### 4.1 Onboarding tooling

`moneropay-core --init` (optionally `--stagenet`/`--testnet`, `--config <path>`) is
an interactive wizard that produces or merges `moneropay.toml` — curated node
choice with a live "test this connection now" check, the `[wallet]` bootstrap
walked through field by field (or, on a re-run against an existing bootstrap,
offered as keep-as-is / add an allowed origin / replace entirely), and a rendered
file with every setting present, active or commented with its default. It
deliberately does not generate wallet key material — a self-hoster brings their
own existing wallet (§3, non-goals).

Three further flags (`--rotate-secret`, `--show-tenant`, `--snippet`, each taking
`--config` and, for a hosted instance with more than one tenant, `--pk`) operate
directly on the local SQLite file rather than through the HTTP admin API in §10 —
justified by the same reasoning as §6.3's local-file `PlainKeyCustody`: filesystem
access to the box already implies more trust than any `sk_` could grant, and this
is a single-operator, self-hosted tool, not a service with a separate admin role
to keep out. `--snippet` in particular exists to close the onboarding gap of
turning a freshly bootstrapped tenant into a pasteable "Pay with Monero" button —
it prints a ready-to-embed HTML/JS block pre-filled with the tenant's real `pk_`
and an operator-supplied endpoint URL (never derived from `[server].bind`, which
says nothing about the externally-reachable URL once a reverse proxy sits in
front of it).

The database always lives next to whichever config file was actually used
(`moneropay.db` in the config's own directory, not the process's CWD) so these
commands, and the server itself, reliably agree on which file they mean
regardless of the directory `moneropay-core` happens to be launched from.

Components, each with one clear owner of state:

| Component | Owns | Never does |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP API layer | Request/response, auth resolution, CORS/Origin checks | Direct SQLite writes; talks to the writer actor and read pool only |
| `KeyCustody` | Private view keys, scan/derive crypto | Anything involving a spend key; never returns key material to a caller |
| Chain Scanner | Polling monerod, matching outputs, reorg detection | SQLite access — sends match/void events to the writer actor |
| Writer Actor | The single SQLite write connection; all mutations | Outbound HTTP (webhooks go through the delivery worker) |
| Read pool | Pooled read-only SQLite connections (WAL) | Any write |
| Webhook Delivery Worker | Outbound HTTP to merchant endpoints | Order/tenant state mutation beyond its own delivery-log rows |

The diagram's "Static site (GH Pages) + client lib" box describes a self-hoster's own
direct integration against this engine's plain JSON API (§10.3) - real, still
supported, but no longer how the hosted SaaS product (control-plane) works.
`docs/fx_refactor.md` moved fiat pricing, the checkout page, and the embed client
library off this engine entirely: a merchant using control-plane has *that* service
sitting where this diagram shows the static site talking to the engine directly, and
control-plane is the one that talks to this engine's API on the merchant's behalf
(§10.4, §14). This engine's own diagram and JSON API are otherwise unchanged - it
still just watches the chain and manages orders/tenants/webhooks; fiat/checkout is
simply no longer any part of what it does.

## 6. The `KeyCustody` Boundary

**Status: implemented** (`src/key_custody/`). This section describes its role and
contract; see the module doc comments for full rationale.

### 6.1 Why it exists

Every wallet in this system is watch-only (private view key + public spend key only),
so the worst outcome of a compromise is loss of *payment-visibility privacy* for
however many tenants share that key material — never loss of funds, since no code path
anywhere holds a spend key. `KeyCustody` exists to make *where* that view key material
physically lives, and who can read it while it's in use, a swappable implementation
detail rather than something baked into the scanner or the HTTP layer.

- **Self-hosted single-tenant**: a host-level compromise already means "the attacker
  owns the one wallet on the box" regardless of what `KeyCustody` does — so the
  reference `PlainKeyCustody` backend (plaintext, in-process memory, no isolation) is a
  fully appropriate default, not a placeholder to feel bad about.
- **Hosted multi-tenant**: a host-level compromise (rogue admin, compromised
  hypervisor, remote exploit) would otherwise expose *every* tenant's view key at once.
  This is the scenario a hardware-backed implementation (AWS Nitro Enclaves or AMD
  SEV-SNP preferred; SGX specifically is a poor fit because secret-scalar EC
  multiplication — exactly what scanning does — is precisely what SGX's published
  side-channel attacks target) is meant to close, by keeping the key encrypted in
  memory even from a host process with root.

### 6.2 Contract

```rust
pub struct WalletHandle(/* opaque */);           // Copy, Eq, Hash — safe to store/log
pub struct WalletMaterial { /* view key + public spend key, ZeroizeOnDrop */ }
pub struct MatchedOutput { output_index, subaddress_index, amount_piconero: Option<u64> }
pub enum KeyCustodyError { UnknownWallet, InvalidKeyMaterial(String),
                           BackendUnavailable(String), ScanFailed(String) }

#[async_trait]
pub trait KeyCustody: Send + Sync {
    async fn register_wallet(&self, material: WalletMaterial) -> Result<WalletHandle, KeyCustodyError>;
    async fn remove_wallet(&self, handle: WalletHandle) -> Result<(), KeyCustodyError>;
    async fn seal(&self, material: &WalletMaterial) -> Result<Vec<u8>, KeyCustodyError>;
    async fn unseal_and_register(&self, sealed: &[u8]) -> Result<WalletHandle, KeyCustodyError>;
    async fn derive_subaddress(&self, handle: WalletHandle, index: SubaddressIndex, network: Network)
        -> Result<Address, KeyCustodyError>;
    async fn scan_tx_outputs(&self, handle: WalletHandle, tx: &monero::Transaction,
        major_range: Range<u32>, minor_range: Range<u32>) -> Result<Vec<MatchedOutput>, KeyCustodyError>;
}
```

Invariants every implementation (including future ones) must uphold:

1. `WalletMaterial` passed into `register_wallet` must not be retained anywhere the
   caller can reach it again — the only thing that comes back is an opaque handle.
2. `seal`/`unseal_and_register` are the *only* sanctioned way key material crosses the
   at-rest boundary (the `tenants.sealed_key_material` column). `PlainKeyCustody` seals
   to plain bytes (no encryption — consistent with its everywhere-else stance); a
   TEE-backed implementation should seal to something only it can unseal, so a stolen
   database file alone is insufficient even though the same backend keeps keys in the
   clear *while scanning*. At-rest protection and in-use protection are separate
   concerns this pair exists specifically to decouple.
3. `derive_subaddress` requires the private view key internally (subaddress spend-key
   derivation is `S' = S + Hs(v || index)·G`), which is why address issuance goes
   through this boundary and not through the order-creation code path directly.
4. **Cost model**: `scan_tx_outputs`/`derive_subaddress` cost is `O(range size)` scalar
   multiplications *unless the implementation caches the per-range lookup table*, since
   the underlying primitive derives every candidate spend key across the range up
   front. `PlainKeyCustody` caches this per wallet, rebuilding only when the requested
   `(major_range, minor_range)` changes — a tenant with a stable set of pending orders
   pays that cost once, not once per transaction scanned. Any other implementation
   should assume the same and cache accordingly; this cost is a property of Monero's
   stealth-address design, not something the trait tries to hide from callers.
5. Key images (used for double-spend detection, §7.5) are **not** part of this
   boundary — they're public data readable directly from a transaction's inputs,
   unrelated to any wallet's keys, and the chain scanner reads them directly.

### 6.3 `PlainKeyCustody`

The only implementation in v1. In-process `RwLock<HashMap<WalletHandle, WalletEntry>>`,
where `WalletEntry` holds the `ViewPair` plus a `Mutex<Option<CachedTable>>` for the
per-range table cache described above. No encryption at rest, no process isolation.

## 7. Chain Scanning & Payment Detection

### 7.1 `MoneroDaemonClient` (new component, not yet implemented)

A trait wrapping the raw calls the scanner needs against `monerod`, so the scanner's
own logic — especially reorg handling — can be tested against a scripted fake instead
of a live node:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait MoneroDaemonClient: Send + Sync {
    async fn get_height(&self) -> Result<u64, DaemonError>;
    async fn get_block_hash(&self, height: u64) -> Result<String, DaemonError>;
    async fn get_block_transactions(&self, height: u64) -> Result<Vec<monero::Transaction>, DaemonError>;
    async fn get_mempool_transactions(&self) -> Result<Vec<monero::Transaction>, DaemonError>;
    async fn is_key_image_spent(&self, key_images: &[String]) -> Result<Vec<KeyImageStatus>, DaemonError>;
}
```

The real implementation talks to `monerod`'s JSON-RPC and plain-HTTP RPC endpoints over
`reqwest` + `rustls` (never OpenSSL, to keep the static-binary goal intact). `ssl`,
`host`, `port` from `[monero_node]` config select the connection.

**Fallback nodes** (`daemon_fallback::FallbackDaemonClient`): each configured
network's real client is this wrapper around an ordered list of plain
`RpcDaemonClient`s - the primary node from `[monero_node.<network>]` plus any
`[[monero_node.<network>.fallbacks]]` entries - rather than a single `RpcDaemonClient`
directly. It implements `MoneroDaemonClient` itself, so nothing downstream (the
scanner, `run_scan_tick`) knows or cares that more than one node might be involved.
Every call starts at whichever node last succeeded and walks forward through the rest
on failure, wrapping around; there is no background health-check, since the next real
call *is* the health check. A self-hoster relying on a single community-run public
node - the common case this project targets - stays exposed to that node's own
downtime unless they add at least one fallback. This trades reliability for a wider
trust surface - see §7.7's "Fallback nodes widen this trust boundary" for what
adding a fallback actually costs.

### 7.2 0-conf and confirmed detection

- **Mempool**: poll `get_mempool_transactions` on a fixed interval (config
  `mempool_poll_interval_ms`, default ~1000ms). Every returned transaction is run
  through `scan_tx_outputs` for every tenant currently on the active watchlist (§7.3).
- **Blocks**: poll `get_height`; on increase, fetch and scan each new block's
  transactions the same way, and record `(height, block_hash)` into `scanned_blocks`.
- A matched output becomes (or updates) one `order_payments` row, sent to the writer
  actor as a message, never written directly by a scan worker.

### 7.3 Active watchlist

Scanning cost is inherently per-`(tx, tenant)` — Monero's stealth addresses require a
scalar multiplication per candidate view key, unlike Bitcoin's hash-lookupable
addresses. The overwhelming majority of registered tenants have no pending order at any
given moment, so the scanner must not pay that cost for them:

- An in-memory map, `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<TenantId, (WalletHandle, Range<u32>)>>>` (the
  "watchlist"), holds only tenants with at least one non-terminal order.
- The writer actor adds/removes a tenant from this map the instant an order becomes
  non-terminal / reaches a terminal state — no polling, no DB query per tx.
- On boot, every non-disabled tenant's `sealed_key_material` is passed through
  `unseal_and_register` to obtain a fresh `WalletHandle` for this process's lifetime
  (`PlainKeyCustody`'s registry is in-memory-only and does not survive a restart); the
  watchlist itself is then populated from `orders WHERE status NOT IN (...)` per
  tenant.
- The range per tenant is `0..next_minor_index` (§8.2) — this only grows over a
  tenant's lifetime in v1, which is acceptable given the `KeyCustody` table cache makes
  it a one-time cost per *new order*, not per transaction scanned.

### 7.4 Scan worker pool

Matching is CPU-bound (elliptic-curve scalar multiplication) and must never run inline
on the tokio runtime's async worker threads, or it stalls every other in-flight
request for its duration. A small, explicitly-bounded pool (sized to leave cores free
for the router's other duties, e.g. `num_cpus - 1`, minimum 1, configurable) fans
`(tx, active_tenant)` pairs out and sends results to the writer actor over a channel —
pool workers never touch SQLite directly (§9).

### 7.5 Reorg and double-spend detection

Motivation: real Monero mining-pool reorgs (of the kind seen from large hashrate
concentrations) can revert blocks a merchant may already have treated as confirmed.
This must be detected and reported, never silently ignored, and never something this
service attempts to prevent (that's a Monero-consensus question, not an application
one) — only to *notice and report*.

**Detecting a reorg**: for every scanned block, compare the hash `monerod` now reports
for that height against what's stored in `scanned_blocks`. A mismatch means everything
from that height up must be re-evaluated. The window pruned into `scanned_blocks` only
needs to be modestly deeper than `confirmations_required` (config
`reorg_check_depth`), not unbounded.

**Re-evaluating an affected `order_payments` row** (whose `block_height` falls in the
reorged range):

1. Tx reappears in a later/different block → update `block_height`; no status
   implication beyond a confirmation-count recompute.
2. Tx reappears in the mempool → `block_height = NULL`; falls back to unconfirmed.
3. Tx is nowhere (mempool or any block) → **ambiguous** until proven otherwise: call
   `is_key_image_spent` on the key images captured for that row at match time
   (`order_payments.key_images_json` — plain public data read directly from
   `tx.prefix.inputs`, entirely outside `KeyCustody`). Never void a payment on this
   ambiguous evidence alone — only on an affirmative "spent in blockchain by a
   different txid" result. Otherwise: still propagating, re-check later.

**On confirmed double-spend**: set `order_payments.voided_at`, recompute the owning
order's `status` (§7.6) and `amount_received_piconero` from the remaining non-voided
rows, stamp `orders.double_spend_detected_at` if not already set, enqueue an
`order.double_spend_detected` webhook (independent of whatever `order.<status>`
webhook, if any, results from the recompute — see §11).

All of that is **one transaction** (`scanner::void_and_notify`), not a void followed
by bookkeeping. A void is a committed write whose consequences cannot be re-derived
later: the voided row is excluded from every subsequent reconciliation input set by
construction, and an order in a terminal status is skipped by the per-tick recompute —
which is precisely the state that matters here, since the merchant has already been
told it was paid. Deferring the recompute to the end of the pass meant one unreachable
node partway through left an order permanently reading `paid` for money that had been
double-spent, with no event ever sent.

**Double-spends that involve no reorg at all**: reorg detection is triggered by a
stored block hash ceasing to match, which by construction only ever fires for a
payment that was *mined*. The textbook attack on a merchant watching the mempool
never gets that far: broadcast transaction A so the merchant's node sees it (with a
`zero_conf_max_xmr` ceiling configured, the order reads `paid` immediately — that is
what the setting is for), then get transaction B, spending the same inputs, mined
instead. A is never mined, no recorded block hash ever changes, and the payment would
otherwise sit at `block_height IS NULL` forever, counting in full towards an order
nobody paid.

So every tick also sweeps the payments that are still mempool-only
(`scanner::check_vanished_mempool_payments`). A payment whose transaction is still in
the pool snapshot the tick already fetched costs nothing; one mined this tick has had
its height written by the block scan before the sweep runs. Only a transaction that
has genuinely left the pool without being mined is looked up, and it is resolved by
exactly the evidence rules above: re-located if it turns out to be in a block, voided
only on an affirmative `SpentInBlockchain`, and otherwise left alone. That last case
is not rare or hostile — Monero has no replace-by-fee, but a transaction can still
expire out of a pool (`CRYPTONOTE_MEMPOOL_TX_LIVETIME`, three days), be dropped under
memory pressure, or simply never propagate — and "the customer's transaction is gone
from this node's pool" never proves it will not be mined later.

**Reorg depth is a configuration decision, not a code one.** `reorg_check_depth`
bounds what can be reconciled at all: a reorg whose fork point falls below the window
is still *detected* (every stored hash in the window mismatches, so the window's lower
edge is reported as the reorg point), but the payments orphaned below it are never
re-evaluated and the replacement chain's blocks below it are never rescanned. The
default (20) was chosen when Monero reorgs were single-block events. Monero mainnet
has since produced an 18-block reorg (September 2025, during the Qubic mining
campaign), and at least one major exchange responded by requiring 720 confirmations on
XMR deposits. A deployment accepting meaningful value should set both
`confirmations_required` and `reorg_check_depth` against that reality rather than
against the defaults.

### 7.6 Order status: a pure, always-recomputed function

This is the single source of truth for `orders.status`, called after **every**
mutation to `order_payments` (new match, reorg moves a height, reorg voids a row) —
never patched incrementally per event type. Treating a double-spend as "the order's
new status" (rather than an orthogonal fact) was an earlier design mistake, caught by
walking through a two-transaction example where only one of two contributing payments
gets voided — see §7.5 and the schema comment on `orders.double_spend_detected_at` for
why the two are kept separate.

```
valid    = order_payments rows for this order WHERE voided_at IS NULL
total    = SUM(valid.amount_piconero)
min_conf = MIN(confirmations of each row in valid)   -- an unconfirmed row contributes 0
all_zero_conf = every row in valid has block_height IS NULL

if total >= xmr_amount_piconero:
    if min_conf >= confirmations_required:
        return total > xmr_amount_piconero ? overpaid : paid
    elif zero_conf_max_piconero is not null
         and total <= zero_conf_max_piconero:
        return total > xmr_amount_piconero ? overpaid : paid   # merchant-configured 0-conf trust
        # Deliberately NOT also gated on all_zero_conf. The ceiling waives the
        # confirmation requirement for small totals; adding `and all_zero_conf`
        # withdrew that waiver the moment the tx was mined, so an order under the
        # ceiling went paid -> confirming -> paid as an ordinary block arrived, with
        # no reorg involved. That both retracts an order.paid the merchant may have
        # shipped against and re-announces the later `paid` under a fresh event_id
        # (i.e. as a genuine second transition, not a redelivery). A mined payment
        # strictly dominates the mempool sighting already being trusted, so the
        # ceiling alone is the correct condition and keeps the ladder monotone in
        # evidence.
    elif all_zero_conf:
        return unconfirmed   # full amount seen, mempool only, not (yet) trusted
    else:
        return confirming    # at least one payment on-chain, not enough confirmations yet
else:
    if now() > expires_at:
        return expired       # even a partial payment past the deadline surfaces as expired;
                              # the funds still exist at the address and require manual
                              # merchant handling — no automated refund path exists (§3)
    elif total == 0:
        return pending
    else:
        return partial
```

`double_spend_detected_at` is never read by this function and never written by it — it
is set exactly once (first occurrence) by the reorg-handling path in §7.5 and otherwise
left alone, including when `status` later recovers to `paid` via other contributing
transactions.

### 7.7 What the scanner takes on trust from its node

The scanner is a *client* of one configured `monerod` per network (`main.rs` builds a
`HashMap<Network, Arc<dyn MoneroDaemonClient>>`; there is no pool, no quorum, and no
second opinion). It validates no proof of work, no difficulty, no block timestamps and
no transaction signatures — that is the node's job, and duplicating it would mean
building a second Monero implementation inside a payment gateway. What follows is
therefore the deliberate trust boundary, written down so it is a decision rather than
an assumption.

**Trusted, with no cross-check possible:**

- **`get_height`.** Confirmation counts are `current_height - block_height + 1` off
  whatever the node reports. A node claiming a higher tip than exists ages payments
  faster than the chain does. This is not separately fixable: a node willing to lie
  about its height can as cheaply serve a fabricated chain of block hashes to back the
  lie up, so clamping confirmations to the scanner's own high-water mark would raise
  the attacker's cost by nothing while making every honest post-reorg rewind
  briefly under-count. (Covered as executable documentation by
  `an_inflated_reported_height_inflates_confirmations_which_is_an_accepted_trust_boundary`.)
- **`is_key_image_spent`.** A false "spent in blockchain" causes a valid payment to be
  voided; a false "unspent" delays (never prevents) detection of a real double-spend,
  since the check is re-run on every subsequent reorg and mempool sweep. Nothing else
  the scanner holds can corroborate a key-image status — key images are exactly the
  data a light client cannot derive for itself. **Partially closed when a fallback
  node is configured** - see "Fallback nodes widen this trust boundary" below for
  both the prevention (`is_key_image_spent_corroborated`) and recovery
  (`revalidate_recent_double_spend_voids`) halves of the fix. A self-hoster running a
  single node still has no corroboration source and is fully exposed to this trust
  boundary as originally described.
- **Block contents.** A node that omits a transaction from a block hides a payment;
  one that invents transactions cannot manufacture a payment, because a payment row
  exists only where `KeyCustody` matched an output against the tenant's own view key,
  which the node does not have.
- **Mempool contents.** Omission costs zero-conf detection and nothing else — the
  payment is still found when it is mined. Invention is inert, for the same reason as
  block contents.

**Not trusted — checked against what was recorded:**

- **Chain history.** Every scanned block's `(height, hash)` is stored and re-compared
  against whatever the node now reports (§7.5). This check has no notion of *why* the
  chain changed, which is what makes it cover more than reorgs: a node that has been
  replaced, rolled back, eclipsed onto an attacker's fork, or is simply lying about
  history presents as a hash mismatch and is reconciled identically. This is also why
  there is no per-daemon sync state to keep — the record is of what *this scanner*
  accepted, and it is re-validated against whoever answers next, so swapping daemons
  needs no special handling (`swapping_to_a_daemon_serving_a_different_chain_reconciles_exactly_like_a_reorg`).
- **Payments already recorded.** Never removed on absence, only on affirmative proof
  (§7.5), so a node that "forgets" a transaction cannot make a merchant's money
  disappear from the record.

**Fallback nodes widen this trust boundary, not just its reliability.**
`daemon_fallback::FallbackDaemonClient` (added for production reliability, not for
this section's threat model) fails over between a network's configured primary node
and its `fallbacks` on any single call failure. Everything above about "the node" is
trusted per network was written for exactly one node; with fallbacks configured it
now means trusting *whichever* of them answers a given call, with no quorum and no
cross-check between them - a compromised or eclipsed fallback is exactly as trusted
as the primary the moment it starts answering. Two consequences worth naming
explicitly, both pinned by tests rather than left as unverified worry:

- **A fallback presenting a different chain reconciles exactly like a reorg** -
  the property proven above for a hand-swapped daemon holds identically for a real
  failover decision
  (`failing_over_through_a_real_fallback_client_to_a_node_serving_a_different_chain_reconciles_like_a_reorg`),
  and a fallback that is simply behind rather than diverging neither rewinds the
  scanned window nor falsely voids anything
  (`failing_over_to_a_lagging_but_honest_fallback_neither_rewinds_nor_corrupts_the_window`).
  Total loss of every configured node for a network fails that tick cleanly - an
  ordinary retryable error, no partial writes -
  (`every_fallback_node_being_down_fails_the_tick_cleanly_without_corrupting_stored_state`).
- **A narrower, genuinely new gap**: `run_scan_tick` fetches a block's transactions
  and its hash as two separate daemon calls (see the comment above
  `daemon.get_block_hash(height)` in `run_scan_tick`). Failover is per-call, so those
  two calls for the same height are not guaranteed to land on the same node - if the
  first succeeds against the primary and the primary dies before the second, the
  height gets recorded with one node's transactions paired with a *different* node's
  hash, a pairing that does not correspond to any single node's real block. This is a
  sharper version of a risk already accepted for one node (the "replication lag
  across a pool of backend nodes behind a public endpoint" case in `run_scan_tick`'s
  bootstrap branch), now bounded only by how different two independently operated
  nodes are allowed to be rather than how out-of-sync one endpoint's own backends
  are. Confirmed to actually happen, not just theorized, by
  `a_node_that_dies_between_fetching_a_blocks_transactions_and_its_hash_can_pair_them_with_a_different_nodes_hash`.
  Not fixed here: the per-call failover granularity that causes it is also what lets
  a tick survive a node dying *partway through*, which is a real resilience win
  worth keeping; pinning it to one node per tick would trade this narrow, low-
  probability inconsistency for aborting the whole tick's remaining work on any
  mid-tick blip.
- **`is_key_image_spent` is fixed, not just documented, once a fallback is
  configured** - the one item on this list where "widens the trust boundary" turned
  out to have a real answer rather than only a tradeoff to accept. Two parts,
  addressing prevention and recovery separately since a single-node deployment can
  only ever benefit from the second:
  - **Prevention**: `MoneroDaemonClient::is_key_image_spent_corroborated` (default:
    delegates to the plain call, unchanged for every single-node client) is what
    `void_if_double_spend_proven` calls instead of the bare method.
    `FallbackDaemonClient`'s override polls *every* configured node - not just the
    "sticky" one everything else uses - and affirms `SpentInBlockchain` only when
    all of them agree; a genuine disagreement is logged and treated as *not* spent,
    since a missed double-spend is merely re-checked again later while a false one
    permanently voids real money. Proven to actually prevent the exact attack a
    single lying node used to cause
    (`a_fallback_daemon_that_disagrees_with_the_primary_prevents_the_wrongful_void_a_single_lying_node_would_cause`),
    without weakening genuine detection when every node honestly agrees - the
    overwhelmingly common case even with a fallback configured
    (`a_fallback_daemon_still_voids_a_real_double_spend_every_node_agrees_on`).
  - **Recovery**: `scanner::revalidate_recent_double_spend_voids`, a separate,
    slow (every few minutes, see `main.rs`) background sweep bounded to voids from
    the last `DOUBLE_SPEND_RECHECK_WINDOW_SECS` (48h) - the *only* other path,
    alongside `check_for_reorg_and_reconcile`'s reverse check, that can ever reverse
    a void, and the only one that does not require a reorg to also be independently
    detected first. Reversing via this path clears the order's sticky
    `double_spend_detected_at` flag (once every voided payment on the order has
    been cleared, not as a side effect of clearing just one of several -
    `revalidate_recent_double_spend_voids_keeps_the_flag_set_while_another_voided_payment_still_justifies_it`)
    and fires a distinct `order.double_spend_reversed` webhook, unlike the
    reorg-driven reversal path, which deliberately leaves both alone (a real
    conflicting transaction genuinely existed there for a time in that story, even
    though it was later reorged away - this path exists specifically because the
    original accusation may never have been true at all). Exists specifically for
    the single-node deployment, which has nothing to corroborate against and so
    cannot benefit from prevention alone.

**The deployment consequence**: the node is a trusted component. Point this service at
your own `monerod`, not at a public endpoint you do not control, whenever the payments
matter — and note that a *single* node is also the unit an eclipse attack targets
(there is published work on practical eclipse attacks against Monero's P2P layer), so
"my own node" means one whose peers you are willing to trust too.

### 7.8 Merchant-triggered order rescan

Full design record: [`docs/order_rescan_wbs.md`](order_rescan_wbs.md). Summary for
future readers of this file:

**The problem.** §7.3's active watchlist drops a tenant the moment every one of its
orders is terminal, and an `expired` order is terminal — so a customer who pays *after*
their order's own deadline (a late payment, mempool congestion, simple confusion) is
invisible to ordinary live scanning the instant `expires_at` passes, with no automatic
recovery.

**Two layers of defense, not one:**

1. **A default grace period** — `active_tenant_ids`/`non_terminal_order_ids`
   (`store.rs`) both widen their in-scope predicate with `OR (status = 'expired' AND
   expires_at >= now - expired_order_grace_period_minutes)`. Automatic, no merchant
   action, default 6h — catches the common case (paid moments late) for free. No other
   scanner-core change was needed to make a late match against an already-`expired`
   order settle correctly: `record_scan_match`'s `touched` set already gets unioned
   into every tick's recompute sweep regardless of status.
2. **A manual, merchant-triggered rescan**, for after the grace window has genuinely
   elapsed — a customer reports a payment days later. `scanner::rescan_order` walks a
   bounded `[from_height, to_height]` block range for one order's one subaddress,
   reusing the exact same `scan_transaction`/`record_scan_match` primitives live
   scanning uses (a narrower caller, not a second implementation), then does one final
   pass over the current mempool. The historical walk deliberately gets a fixed
   safety cushion on its *start* height only (`RESCAN_START_HEIGHT_CUSHION_BLOCKS`,
   guarding against `find_height_at_or_before`'s timestamp→height binary search
   landing slightly late on Monero's non-strictly-monotonic block timestamps); the
   *end* side gets no equivalent buffer, because §7.5's reorg/double-spend
   reconciliation already re-examines every recorded payment within
   `reorg_check_depth` of the tip regardless of the owning order's status — a payment
   the rescan records, even one that immediately settles the order, inherits that
   protection automatically.

**Durability.** A triggered rescan is a real row in `order_rescans` (§8), not an
in-memory task: `status = 'running'` survives a server restart as-is (no separate
"interrupted" state), and the engine re-spawns `scanner::run_rescan_job` for every such
row at boot (`Store::list_running_rescans`), resuming from the row's own
`current_height` — never the original `from_height` again, and never a
`to_height` recomputed against a newer tip. A partial unique index enforces one
running rescan per tenant at a time.

**Scanned-range bookkeeping and its own guardrail.** Every order accumulates
`first_scanned_height`/`last_scanned_height` (§8), bumped by ordinary live scanning
(§7.3's watchlist) and by a manual rescan alike, via `MIN`/`MAX` — never replaced, so
the range only ever grows. This makes the range's display trustworthy (a merchant can
tell "was the block range around when my customer says they paid actually checked") only
because of one guardrail: the trigger endpoint rejects an advanced-mode `to` that
resolves earlier than the order's existing `last_scanned_height`. Without it, a narrow
advanced-mode request could leave a real, silent gap between the old high-water mark
and the new rescan's own end that the min/max range would then hide entirely, showing a
continuous span with an actual hole in it.

## 8. Data Model

Canonical DDL: [`migrations/0001_init.sql`](../migrations/0001_init.sql) — validated
against a real `sqlite3` (constraints exercised live: `CHECK` on `status`,
`UNIQUE(tenant_id, minor_index)`, `UNIQUE(txid, output_index)`, and the foreign keys).
Reproduced here for reference; the migration files are the source of truth if these ever
diverge — in particular this snapshot predates migrations 0002-0006 (a scanned-blocks
`network` column, the order-payments uniqueness constraint becoming order-scoped, and
the two `docs/fx_refactor.md` migrations below), so treat the column lists as
illustrative of the model's shape, not a byte-for-byte current schema dump.

`docs/fx_refactor.md` (Phase 3/4) dropped `orders.fiat_currency`/`fiat_amount`/
`exchange_rate` and `tenants.template_dir` from the columns below — the engine has no
concept of fiat/FX or per-tenant checkout customization left in it at all; `xmr_amount_piconero`
is the sole source of truth for what an order is worth, and any fiat display is a
control-plane concern (its own local `order_fiat_metadata` table, not part of this schema).

### 8.1 Design notes

- **Money is never a float.** `fiat_amount` and `exchange_rate` are decimal strings.
- **`key_custody_backend`** lets a future migration to a different `KeyCustody`
  implementation fail loudly on a format mismatch rather than silently
  misinterpreting `sealed_key_material` bytes.
- **`order_payments` is append-mostly, never deleted.** Voided rows are kept
  (`voided_at` set) as the audit trail for "why does this order show partial" or "when
  was this order double-spent" — both answerable without reading logs.
- **`webhook_deliveries` is a queue-as-table**, not a separate broker — matters for
  staying a single small binary. The partial index on `next_attempt_at` is what the
  delivery worker's claim query uses; this has been verified live to be selected by
  SQLite's query planner for that exact query shape.

### 8.2 Why minor indices are never recycled (v1)

Each order gets a subaddress index no other order for that tenant has ever used, so two
customers are never watching the same address (a subaddress *reused* across two orders
would let one customer observe when the other's payment lands). The cost is the active
scan range only grows over a tenant's lifetime — acceptable at realistic v1 volumes
given the `KeyCustody` cache (§6.2 point 4), and explicitly deferred rather than solved
speculatively (§3).

### 8.3 Order rescan additions (§7.8)

Two columns added to `orders` (migration 0008):

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN first_scanned_height INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN last_scanned_height INTEGER;
```

Both `NULL` until an order is first examined by anything — never backfilled to
`created_at`'s own height. Accumulated by `MIN`/`MAX`, never replaced, by two
independent writers (ordinary live scanning and a manual rescan) sharing the same
discipline — see §7.8 for why that, plus the gap-prevention guardrail, is what keeps
the displayed range genuinely continuous rather than merely usually so.

A new table, `order_rescans` (migration 0007), one row per triggered job:

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_rescans (
    id             TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id       TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES orders(id),
    tenant_id      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),
    minor_index    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    mode           TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (mode IN ('simple', 'advanced')),
    status         TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('running', 'completed', 'failed')),
    from_height    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    to_height      INTEGER NOT NULL,
    current_height INTEGER NOT NULL,
    error          TEXT,
    started_at     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    finished_at    INTEGER,
    updated_at     INTEGER NOT NULL
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX order_rescans_one_running_per_tenant
    ON order_rescans (tenant_id) WHERE status = 'running';
CREATE INDEX order_rescans_order_id ON order_rescans (order_id);
```

`mode` is purely informational — what actually governs the walk is `from_height`/
`to_height`, already resolved to concrete block heights at trigger time. `status` has
no `interrupted` value: a row left `running` when the process stopped simply *is*
still running as far as this table is concerned (§7.8's restart-resume). The partial
unique index is the one-running-rescan-per-tenant guardrail, enforced atomically at
the database level rather than by a separate check-then-insert.

## 9. Concurrency Model

- **Runtime**: `tokio`, with an explicitly configurable `worker_threads` (default
  conservative, e.g. 2), so the service has a hard, predictable CPU ceiling independent
  of how many client connections (including long-lived SSE streams) are open — chosen
  over a thread-per-connection sync model specifically because idle SSE connections are
  effectively free as parked tasks, whereas each would pin a full OS thread otherwise.
- **Writer actor**: a single task owning the one SQLite write connection. All mutations
  — minor-index allocation, order creation, payment matches, reorg-driven updates and
  voids, webhook-delivery enqueueing — funnel through one `mpsc` channel to it, so
  SQLite's single-writer constraint is satisfied by construction rather than by
  discipline. It is also the natural point to push SSE updates to subscribers, since it
  already knows exactly what changed.
- **Scan workers**: a bounded pool doing pure CPU-bound matching (§7.4), no DB access,
  sending results to the writer over a channel.
- **Read pool**: separate pooled read-only connections (SQLite WAL mode) for
  `GET`/status-poll handlers, independent of the writer so a slow write never blocks a
  status poll.
- **Webhook delivery worker**: separate async task(s) polling due `webhook_deliveries`
  rows and performing outbound HTTP — isolated so a slow or hostile merchant endpoint
  can never stall order-state commits.

## 10. HTTP API Surface

All JSON endpoints share one version prefix, `/api/v1`, including admin routes — there
is no principled reason to exempt admin from the same breaking-change discipline the
public surface gets, and a reverse-proxy rule restricting admin traffic (e.g. to a LAN)
matches on `/api/v1/admin/*` exactly as easily as on a bare `/admin/*`.

The engine no longer has a checkout/payment-link page of its own at all
(`docs/fx_refactor.md` Phase 2-4): that HTML surface, and everything fiat/FX-shaped,
moved to control-plane, which is now the only thing that renders a page a customer's
browser ever sees. What follows in this section is strictly the engine's own remaining
JSON API — `xmr_amount_piconero` only, no fiat concept anywhere in it.

### 10.1 Auth model

Two credential types per tenant:

- **`pk_...` (public key)** — embedded in the merchant's static site JS. Identifies
  which tenant's orders/widget a request concerns. Not a secret; never accepted as
  authorization for anything.
- **`sk_...` (admin secret)** — stored only as a SHA-256 hex digest
  (`secret_token_hash`, unique-indexed for O(1) lookup). Deliberately not a slow,
  memory-hard hash like Argon2id: the token is high-entropy and machine-generated, not
  a human password, so there is no brute-force-resistance benefit to buy — only the
  cost of turning every auth check into a linear Argon2-verify scan over all tenants.
  Comparing the hash of the presented token against the stored hash with plain `==` is
  fine here too (no separate constant-time compare needed): the attacker controls the
  hash's *input*, not its output, and SHA-256's avalanche effect means a near-miss
  input has no predictable relationship to a near-miss digest, unlike comparing a raw
  secret byte-by-byte. Shown to the tenant exactly once (creation or rotation
  response).

**Structural rule, not a per-handler discipline**: every `/api/v1/admin/tenant/...`
route resolves *which* tenant is being operated on **entirely from the `sk_` bearer
token**, never from a path parameter. This was a deliberate correction during design —
an earlier draft had `/admin/tenants/{id}/...` alongside a separate bearer token,
which is exactly the shape that invites an IDOR (tenant A's valid token + tenant B's
`id` in the URL) unless every handler remembers to cross-check the two. Removing `{id}`
from these routes removes the bug class structurally: there is nothing in the URL for a
token to be checked against. Any route that still needs a client-supplied identifier
within a tenant's own scope (e.g. `{payment_id}`) must filter its query by *both* that
identifier *and* the token-resolved `tenant_id` (`WHERE id = ? AND tenant_id = ?`,
never `WHERE id = ?` alone) — ideally enforced once, centrally, by middleware that hands
every handler an already-scoped tenant context, not re-implemented per handler.

### 10.2 Admin API (`/api/v1/admin/...`)

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/tenants` | none (DDoS layer only, §12) | `{view_key_hex, spend_pubkey_hex, network, allowed_origins[], confirmations_required?, zero_conf_max_xmr?, order_expiry_seconds?}` → `{tenant_id, public_key, secret_token}` (secret shown once) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant` | `sk_` | Own config; never returns `sealed_key_material` or the token hash |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant` | `sk_` | Mutable fields only: `allowed_origins`, `confirmations_required`, `zero_conf_max_xmr`, `order_expiry_seconds`. Key material and `public_key` are immutable — rotate by creating a new tenant |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant/rotate-secret` | `sk_` | Invalidates the old secret, returns a new one once |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant` | `sk_` | Soft-delete: `key_custody.remove_wallet()`, set `disabled_at`; orders keep a valid FK |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant/orders?status=&cursor=` | `sk_` | Paginated; each row also carries `first_scanned_height`/`last_scanned_height`/`currently_scanning` (§7.8) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant/orders/{payment_id}` | `sk_` | Includes `order_payments` audit trail and the same three scanned-range fields |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant/orders/{payment_id}/rescan` | `sk_` | `{mode: "simple"\|"advanced", from?, to?}` → the triggered job's state (§7.8) - `Expired` orders only |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant/orders/{payment_id}/rescan` | `sk_` | The most recently triggered rescan for this order, `404` if none ever was (§7.8) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant/rescans` | `sk_` | Every currently-`running` rescan for this tenant; real HTTP caching (`ETag`/`Cache-Control`/`If-None-Match`, §7.8) |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant/webhooks` | `sk_` | `{url, extra_headers?}` → `{webhook_id, signing_secret}` (shown once — an API convention here, not a hashing guarantee, since HMAC signing needs the real bytes on every delivery) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant/webhooks` | `sk_` | List (never re-shows `signing_secret`) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/admin/tenant/webhooks/{id}` | `sk_` | Rotation is delete+recreate in v1 |

### 10.3 Public API (`/api/v1/t/{pk}/...`)

No bearer auth — scoped by `pk_` in the path plus an `allowed_origins` check on
`Origin`, independent of the CORS header itself.

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/t/{pk}/orders` | `{merchant_order_id?, xmr_amount_piconero, description?}` → `{payment_id, address, xmr_amount_piconero, expires_at}` — the caller (in practice, control-plane's own order-creation endpoint) supplies the exact piconero amount an order is worth; the engine does no fiat lookup of any kind (`docs/fx_refactor.md` Phase 3) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/t/{pk}/orders/{payment_id}` | Status poll |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/t/{pk}/orders/{payment_id}/refund-address` | Records only; nothing ever sends it |

### 10.4 Checkout page and client library — moved off the engine

Both now live on control-plane, not here (`docs/fx_refactor.md` Phases 2-4):

- The checkout/payment-link page (iframe embed target and standalone customer-facing
  link) is `GET /pay/{pk}/orders/{payment_id}` on control-plane
  (`control-plane/src/http/checkout.rs`), not a route on this engine at all. It shows
  the recomputed `status`, a double-spend explanation banner whenever
  `double_spend_detected_at` is set (§7.6, unrelated to which `status` is currently
  shown), and a fiat amount sourced entirely from control-plane's own local
  `order_fiat_metadata` — this engine has nothing to contribute to that display since
  it stores no fiat data. There is no per-tenant template customization any more:
  every tenant gets the same control-plane-rendered page.
- The embeddable widget script (`MoneroPay.createOrder()`/`.mount()`) is served from
  control-plane at `GET /static/moneropay-client.js` and calls control-plane's own
  `POST /pay/{pk}/orders`, not this engine's API directly.

A self-hoster running the engine alone, with no control-plane in front of it, has
neither of these — they get the plain JSON API in §10.3 and are expected to build
their own checkout experience against it, per this project's own "power users write a
custom integration" stance on that deployment shape.

## 11. Webhook Delivery

- One row is inserted into `webhook_deliveries` per enabled webhook, per **event**, for
  two independent event families:
  - `order.<status>` — fired on a `status` *transition* (recompute produced a different
    value than before), never on a same-status recompute (e.g. a confirmation count
    ticking up without crossing the threshold).
  - `order.double_spend_detected` — fired once per voided `order_payments` row,
    independent of whether that same recompute also produced a status transition. A
    single reorg can legitimately enqueue both, or the double-spend event alone if the
    order's aggregate status didn't move (e.g. a redundant payment still covers it).
- The writer actor enqueues; a separate delivery worker claims due rows
  (`delivered_at IS NULL AND next_attempt_at <= now()`) and performs the HTTP call —
  never the writer itself, so a slow or unresponsive merchant endpoint cannot stall
  order-state commits.
- Each delivery is signed: HMAC-SHA256 of the body using the webhook's
  `signing_secret`, sent as a header (`X-MoneroPay-Signature`).
- Every payload carries a common envelope alongside its event-specific fields:
  `event_id` (`evt_…`, minted once per *event* — every retry of that delivery re-sends
  the same id under the same signature), `event` (the event type, mirroring
  `X-MoneroPay-Event`), and `created_at` (unix seconds). `event_id` is also sent as
  `X-MoneroPay-Event-Id`, read back out of the signed body so header and body can
  never disagree. Both fields are *inside* the signed body deliberately: without an
  id, a retry of a lost-ack delivery is byte-identical to a genuine second transition
  to the same status, and without a timestamp a captured delivery can be replayed
  against the merchant indefinitely.
- Failure handling: short timeout (a few seconds), exponential backoff via
  `attempt_count`/`next_attempt_at`, giving up after a bounded number of attempts (row
  stays for inspection via the admin API, retries just stop).
- Delivery is **at-least-once, not exactly-once** — a merchant's endpoint may see a
  duplicate if a 2xx response is lost after being sent. This is a documented contract,
  not an oversight: webhook handlers are expected to be idempotent, and the payload's
  `event_id` is the value to dedupe on (it is stable across retries of one event and
  distinct between genuinely separate ones).
- **SSRF mitigation is mandatory, on by default.** A merchant-supplied webhook URL is
  an outbound-request vector this server would otherwise make on the operator's
  network — relevant to a home-router self-hoster but critical for a hosted
  multi-tenant operator. The delivery worker must resolve the hostname and reject
  private/loopback/link-local ranges **at connect time**, not just at registration
  (DNS can change between the two), and must not follow redirects blindly. A config
  escape hatch for a self-hoster testing against their own LAN is acceptable; the
  default must be closed.

## 12. DDoS Protections

The realistic threat model: unauthenticated endpoints (`POST /api/v1/t/{pk}/orders`,
`POST /api/v1/admin/tenants`) exist by necessity, since a static site has nowhere to
keep a secret. Layers, cheapest first:

1. **Per-IP token-bucket rate limiting** on state-changing endpoints.
2. **Small request body caps**, enforced before JSON parsing.
3. **`allowed_origins` enforcement independent of the CORS header** — reject
   non-matching `Origin`/`Referer` at the application layer too, not just via the
   browser-enforced CORS mechanism (which is a client-side courtesy, not a server-side
   guarantee).
4. **Optional JS proof-of-work challenge**, gated behind a load threshold (normal
   traffic never sees it) — no third-party CAPTCHA dependency, no accounts.
5. **Bounded global concurrency** (a semaphore in front of the router) in addition to
   per-IP limits — relevant specifically because the async model makes idle
   connections cheap, so an attacker can open far more of them before hitting OS fd
   limits than a thread-per-connection model would allow.
6. **Short connection timeouts**, bounded worker/task counts.
7. **Documented, not implemented**: running behind Tor (hides the home IP entirely) or
   a reverse proxy/CDN for a clearnet domain — a deployment recommendation, not app
   code.

## 13. Configuration Surface (sketch)

```toml
[monero_node]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 18081
ssl = false

[wallet]                      # self-hosted bootstrap only; ignored once tenants exist
primary_address = "4..."
private_view_key = "..."

# No [exchange_rate] section: the engine has no concept of fiat/FX at all
# (`docs/fx_refactor.md` Phase 3/4) - `xmr_amount_piconero` is the only unit an order
# is ever priced in here. A hosted-SaaS front end (control-plane) that wants to quote
# fiat prices owns that lookup entirely on its own side, via its own
# `CONTROL_PLANE_EXCHANGE_RATE_*` environment variables - see
# `control-plane/src/exchange_rate_config.rs`, not this file.

[payment]
confirmations_required = 10
zero_conf_max_xmr = "0.25"    # XMR, not fiat: compared against the piconero total received
order_expiry_minutes = 30
reorg_check_depth = 20        # blocks; should exceed confirmations_required with margin
mempool_poll_interval_ms = 1000
# `docs/order_rescan_wbs.md` - merchant-triggered order rescan (§7.8 below).
default_rescan_lookback_days = 7    # "simple" mode's own fixed window, measured back from now
max_rescan_lookback_days = 90       # hard ceiling both simple and advanced modes share
expired_order_grace_period_minutes = 360  # 6h - how long past expires_at ordinary live scanning keeps watching an order; 0 disables it

[server]
bind = "0.0.0.0:8443"
worker_threads = 2
tls = "rustls"                # rustls | none (behind an external reverse proxy)
tls_cert = "/etc/moneropay/cert.pem"
tls_key = "/etc/moneropay/key.pem"

[templates]
dir = "/etc/moneropay/templates"   # overridable with --templates-dir

[ddos]
rate_limit_per_ip_per_min = 20
max_body_bytes = 8192
pow_challenge = "auto"        # off | auto | always

[webhooks]
allow_private_urls = false    # SSRF escape hatch, self-hosted LAN testing only
delivery_timeout_ms = 5000
max_attempts = 8
```

Two rescan-related knobs live outside this file entirely:

- **`RESCAN_START_HEIGHT_CUSHION_BLOCKS`** (`src/scanner.rs`) - the fixed safety margin
  (720 blocks, ~24h) subtracted from a rescan's timestamp-derived start height (§7.8) -
  covers both the timestamp binary search's own slop and the advanced-mode date
  fields' inherent timezone ambiguity (control-plane labels them UTC; a plain
  `<input type="date">` carries no timezone at all). A compile-time constant, not
  configuration, for now - there has been no operational need yet to tune it per
  deployment.
- **`CONTROL_PLANE_HTTP_CACHE_MAX_MB`** - control-plane's own environment variable
  (default 16), not part of this engine's TOML at all. Sizes the byte-bounded HTTP
  response cache (`shared::http_cache`) control-plane uses for every outbound call to
  this engine's admin API and to Coingecko - see `shared/src/http_cache.rs`'s own
  module doc comment.

## 14. Client Library

**Moved off this engine entirely** (`docs/fx_refactor.md` decision 3): fiat pricing
and the checkout page both live on control-plane now, so the embed library talks to
control-plane, not this engine directly. Served from
`control-plane/static/moneropay-client.js` at `GET /static/moneropay-client.js` on
whichever control-plane instance a merchant is using:

```html
<script src="https://cloud.example.com/static/moneropay-client.js"></script>
<div id="checkout"></div>
<script>
  const order = await MoneroPay.createOrder({
    publicKey: "pk_...",
    fiatAmount: 25.00,
    fiatCurrency: "USD",
  });
  MoneroPay.mount("#checkout", order, {
    onPaid: (o) => window.location = "/thank-you.html",
    onExpired: () => alert("Payment window expired"),
  });
</script>
```

`createOrder()` posts to control-plane's own `POST /pay/{pk}/orders` (§10.3's
XMR-only engine endpoint is never called from the browser); `mount()` injects an
`<iframe src="https://cloud.example.com/pay/{pk}/orders/{paymentId}">` and listens for
`postMessage` events that page posts on status changes. All payment logic and UI lives
server-side in control-plane's own templates; the client library stays thin
deliberately, since it is the one surface running as plain JS on an arbitrary
third-party site with no build step assumed.

A self-hoster running the engine alone, with no control-plane, has no equivalent of
this file at all — see §10.4's closing note.

## 15. Build & Packaging

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP | `axum` on `hyper`/`tokio` | `tower`/`tower-http` give body-size limits, timeouts, and concurrency limiting as drop-in layers instead of hand-rolled code in a security-sensitive path |
| TLS | `rustls` | pure Rust; avoids an OpenSSL dynamic dependency |
| DB | `rusqlite` (`bundled` feature) | SQLite compiled statically into the binary — still a single static executable, no separate DB process |
| Monero crypto | `monero` crate (monero-rs) | pure Rust, no `monero-wallet-rpc` sidecar; verified in this project against real fixture data (see `src/key_custody/plain.rs` tests) |
| Password/token hashing | `argon2` | for `secret_token_hash` |
| Rate limiting | `governor` | in-memory, no Redis |
| Templates | `handlebars` (loaded from disk at runtime) | user-editable files, no recompile needed |
| Build target | `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` / `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` | fully static; covers typical router SoCs |

Explicitly avoided: `monero-wallet-rpc` (separate C++ process), OpenSSL, ZMQ/`libzmq`
— all for the same reason: they conflict with "single static binary, no dynamic
libraries."

## 16. Deferred / Future Work

Listed so a future change doesn't have to rediscover why these were left out:

- TEE-backed `KeyCustody` implementation (Nitro/SEV-SNP preferred over SGX; see §6.1).
- Minor-index recycling/bucketing for high-volume tenants (§8.2).
- ZMQ-based mempool push as an opt-in, feature-flagged alternative to polling.
- A platform/operator admin tier for the hosted deployment, with its own route
  namespace and credential type, entirely separate from tenant `sk_` auth.
- Gated tenant creation (an `operator_token` requirement) for a hosted instance that
  wants invite-only onboarding.
- In-place webhook secret rotation.
- `SubKeyChecker` table-cache improvements beyond the current per-wallet clone (e.g.
  avoiding the `HashMap` clone on every cache hit) if profiling ever shows it matters.
