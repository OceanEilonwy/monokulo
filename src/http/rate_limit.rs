//! Rate limiting for two genuinely different kinds of caller, each with its own
//! limiter and its own key:
//!
//! - **Per-IP**, for the state-changing, necessarily-unauthenticated public
//!   endpoints (order creation chief among them - a static site has nowhere to
//!   keep a secret, so these can't require auth) plus `/status`. See
//!   `docs/DESIGN.md` §12.
//! - **Per-token**, for the `sk_`-authenticated admin API. IP-based limiting is
//!   meaningless there: a hosted control plane calls this API on behalf of
//!   every one of *its own* users from one proxy IP, so a per-IP budget caps
//!   all of them combined rather than any one abusive caller (a real incident -
//!   see `work_notes.md`'s note on the control-plane status page tripping this
//!   for a single real user). Keying on the presented `sk_...` token instead
//!   gives each tenant its own independent budget, the same guarantee per-IP
//!   limiting gives a direct, unproxied caller. A request with no/malformed
//!   token still falls back to its IP (see `admin_rate_limit_middleware`) so
//!   anonymous guessing against these endpoints is still capped by *something*.
//!
//! Both are fixed-window counters, not a proper token bucket - simpler, and
//! sufficient for "stop one source from hammering this endpoint," which is the
//! actual goal. A smarter algorithm is a reasonable future improvement, not a
//! v1 requirement.
